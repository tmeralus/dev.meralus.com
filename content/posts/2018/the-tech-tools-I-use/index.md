[Up to date Tech Stack](https://smakosh.notion.site/Tech-Stack-2022-1cd4d3c244b44d38b666e3b47e090a6d)

If I’m simply coding an interface that I might integrate into a web app I use plain HTML/CSS & vanilla JavaScript.

But if I'm working on a landing page, documentation website, blog or even a large web app I use:

### Primary stack

- The JAM stack:
  - Next.js
  - Serverless functions written in JavaScript/TypeScript (when needed)
  - Headless CMS (when needed), my favorite so far is Contentful after trying a bunch of them
  - Markdown, Yaml, Json etc... (when needed)

> I Have used Gatsby, Jekyll and Pelican before but prefer Next.js

For CSS, I’m cool to use what ever tech available out there that makes my task done quickly & well, I have personally used Bootstrap 3 & 4, Bulma, Lostgrid, Materialize, Skeleton, Tailwind CSS, Tachyons & made my own micro CSS framework called [Unnamed](https://unnamed.smakosh.com/) that has over 200 stars on GitHub. I also was heavily using CSS in JS via CSS modules, Styled-components, emotion and others.

If I had to pick, I would prefer coding with vanilla CSS or Tailwind CSS at this point.

> I'm currently working on a headless UI React library [Ontwik UI](https://github.com/Ontwik-Dev/ontwik-ui).

### Secondary stack

- MERN/PERN stack:
  - TypeScript
  - MongoDB/Postgres
  - Mongoose/Sequelize/Prisma or TypeORM
  - Express/Fastify
  - React (CRA/Next js)
  - Node Js

The MERN/PERN stack is my secondary stack for building web apps

> Checkout my [CRA boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/CRA-boilerplate), will open source my Next js boilerplate ASAP as well.

I use Git bash as my terminal when I’m on windows, iTerm2 with "oh my zsh" themes when I’m on macOS.

> Checkout my [REST API boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/rest-api-boilerplate-v2)
> [GraphQL API](https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-boilerplate) and its [Frontend](https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-next-boilerplate)

### Optional tools

This can be part of the JAM stack

> the "A" part on JAM which stands for APIs

- Firestore
- FaunaDB
- Firebase auth
- Auth0
- Algolia
- Stripe
- Supabase
- etc...

### Mobile stack

- React Native
  > I have used Ionic before, I didn't like it as much as RN.

For native apps, I use React native to build mobile apps (Ios & Android). I also have a personal [boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/RN-personal-boilerplate) that I use to speed up the process which needs to be updated.

### Deployment

- Vercel using their GitHub intergration
- Digital Ocean via GitHub actions
- App Store / Play Store using Fastlane

### Domain name provider

- Namecheap
- Google
